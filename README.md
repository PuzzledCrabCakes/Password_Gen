# Password_Generator
This is a simple password generator. It is designed to give the Apple like passwords.

# Features I might include
I was thinking if I can get the test password working, I might include a GUI and a way to store or save passwords, turning this into a password manager that generates passwords if need be.

# What is included here
There are two files here currently. Version 2 is the most updated one. I created the first one and scrapped it right away to refactor and reduce the code. I am much happier with the version 2 generator.
